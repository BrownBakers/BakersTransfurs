Warning: Although this software was not written with incompatibility in mind, it will likely not work on Microsoft Windows without at least small changes. Please, upgrade to Linux, if you want any support other than a Perl 5 manual and data file format. This software may work on Mac as is, due to top level similarity, but Mac isn't supported either. FreeBSD and other BSD derivatives should also work out of the box, and are more likely to get support than mac. I don't know if anyone wrote a Perl interpreter for Temple OS, and I don't know if this will work there.

Please have fun installing Linux on your PC or trying to fix the code to make it run.
